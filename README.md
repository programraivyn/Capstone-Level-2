# Raivyn's Capstone Project

## About

My capstone project will consist of my bucket list desires, including things I've been longing
to do, as well as places I want to see and visit, and a variety of others things I've always 
wanted to do. I will implement my - B - L - D - or Bucket List Desires in three HTML pages 
which will each illustrate what I've learned with my coding experience at CodeX Academy thus far.
